This is done using blight units based on the SimCast model modified by [Grünwald et al. (2002)](http://grunwaldlab.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/potato-late-blight-management-toluca-valley-field-validation-simcast-modified-cultivars-high-field). Other scripts include tools to predict growing seasons using Ecocrop and estimating global late blight severity using monthly time-step weather data to generate maps of potato late blight risk.\r\n\r\nThe metamodelling approach can be found in [Sparks, A. H., Forbes, G. A., Hijmans, R. J., & Garrett, K. A. (2011). A metamodeling framework for extending the application domain of process-based ecological models. Ecosphere, 2(8), art90. doi:10.1890/ES11-00128.1](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/es11-00128.1).\r\n\r\nThe study for which these models were developed can be found in [Sparks, A. H., Forbes, G. A, Hijmans, R. J., & Garrett K. A. (2014). Climate change may have limited effect on global risk of potato late blight. Global Change Biology, doi:10.1111/gcb.12587](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12587/abstract).\r\n\r\nWhile the first manuscript may be completely replicated, this repository is not a perfect replication of the second manuscipt, Sparks et al. (2014), but is a reproduction using freely available data that can be downloaded from the web as of the time of publishing (Jan 2016). It is intended for the user to be able to reproduce the analysis that I have done and undertake their own efforts with their own data.\r\n\r\nFollowing H. Wickham's style guide, the folders (in bold) and scripts are numbered in the consecutive order in which they should be run. I have already provided blight unit predictions based on the HUSWO data, so 01 - Models/01 - SimCast_Blight_Units.R is not necessary to run and is provided for information purposes here only the script is functional if the user has HUSWO data from 1990-1995. After that, all other scripts are fully usable as provided here.\r\n\r\nThe scripts can easily be run on a modest machine, it only takes a few hours to complete on an Early 2015 MacBook with the Core M 1.3 processor. A reasonably fast Internet connection will assist since there is a good deal of data to be downloaded from various sources. FAO data is used to provide information on the top producing countries, the most recent year provided is used by default.\r\n\r\nHappy modelling!\r\n\r\n## Directory structure ##\r\n* **01 - Models** - Contains the scripts for the models used in this project\r\n    * 01 - SimCast_Blight_Units.R - The blight unit portion of the SimCast model, as described in [Grünwald et al. 2002](http://grunwaldlab.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/potato-late-blight-management-toluca-valley-field-validation-simcast-modified-cultivars-high-field)\r\n    * 02 - SimCastMeta.R - The metamodel, as described in [Sparks et al. 2011](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/es11-00128.1)\r\n    * 03 - EcoCrop CRU CL2.0 Potato Growing Seasons.R - Downloads CRU CL2.0 data from CRU [New et al. 2000](http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/tmc/new_et_al_10minute_climate_CR.pdf)\r\nand MIRCA2000 from Uni Frankfurt, MIRCA2000, [(Portman et al. 2000)](http://www2.uni-frankfurt.de/45218023/MIRCA?legacy_request=1), to generate maps of potato planting dates, output files are found in \"Cache/Planting Seasons\"\r\n    * 04 - EcoCrop CRU A2 Scenario Potato Growing Seasons.R - Downloads A2 Climate data from my Figshare\r\nand MIRCA2000 from Uni Frankfurt, MIRCA2000, [(Portman et al. 2000)](http://www2.uni-frankfurt.de/45218023/MIRCA?legacy_request=1), to generate maps of potato planting dates, output files are found in \"Cache/Planting Seasons\"\r\n\r\n* **02 - Analysis** - Contains scripts that are used for analysis\r\n    * 01 - CRU CL2.0 SimCastMeta_Global_Late_Blight_Risk.R Script that uses SimCastMeta with CRU CL2.0 climate data generating blight unit predictions as raster objects\r\n    * 02 - A2 2050 SimCastMeta_Global_Late_Blight_Risk.R Script that uses SimCastMeta with A2 ensemble climate data generating blight unit predictions as raster objects\r\n    * 03 - Extract_Visualise_Risk_by_Country.R - Script that downloads FAO production data and Natural Earth cultural 1:50 shape files to extract and visualise countries risk rank\r\n\r\n* **Cache** - Contains supporting data that has been modified from original format in some meaningful way.\r\n    * **Blight Units** - Data necessary for creating the models\r\n    * **Global Blight Risk Maps** - Output from the SimCastMeta model, when run using the CRU CL2.0 data\r\n    * **Look Up Tables** - Output from the metamodels as a Temperature/Relative Humidity/Blight Unit value table.
